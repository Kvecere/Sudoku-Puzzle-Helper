My Capstone Seminar project that aids users in solving Sudoku puzzles. This program takes a Sudoku board (via a row-by-row input) and outputs (as a text file) the possible numbers you can put in each empty cell.
Included in this repository is the raw code, some test boards you can try out (as well as the expected output for these boards), and extensive documentation regarding various types of erroneous input and the overall progress of the project.

Note: While this project was written in C++, it was ultimately coded to be as close to C as possible.
