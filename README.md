My Capstone Seminar project that aids users in solving Sudoku puzzles. This program takes a Sudoku board (via a row-by-row input) and outputs (as a text file) the possible numbers you can put in each empty cell.
Included in this repository is the raw code, some test boards you can try out, and extensive documentation.
